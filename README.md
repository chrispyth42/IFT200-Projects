# IFT200 Repo

This small repo was made as part of the Windows AD course at ASU, in Spring 2019. I had known github existed well beforehand, but this repo was my proper introduction to it. Contains Powershell scripts pertaining to user/configuration management within a Windows Server 2016 Active Directory
